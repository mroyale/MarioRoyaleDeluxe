MARIO ROYALE DELUXE IS RELEASED! FEBRUARY 11TH 2023!
Release notes: Cloudflare glitch resulted in many people unable to access the site.

Bugs:
- If you crouch jump in water, the swimming form appears. This is fine normally but under blocks means you can clip into blocks.

Features to add, backport and whatever the hell else:
- Chat (things needed: swear filter)
- Spectator (urgh this was a pain to add in legacy and will be here.)
- Hammer suit (AAAAAAAAAAAAA i don't think this will be that hard I just need the hammer delay to be lower or something)
- private lobbies (this is painful because of uploading levels. also i need to rework this to use an automatic code system like ADASIGHA)
- tile animations to editor
