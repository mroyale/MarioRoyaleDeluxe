MARIO ROYALE IS RELEASED! FEBRUARY 11TH 2023!
Release notes: Cloudflare glitch resulted in many people unable to access the site.

Bugs:
- Koopas fall too fast
- Linking to a version number in the patch notes (i.e. https://marioroyale.com/royale/patch.html#1.0.0) breaks the container. Can't figure out why this happens but it hardly matters.

Features to add, backport and whatever the hell else:
- Chat (things needed: swear filter)
- Spectator (urgh this was a pain to add in legacy and will be here.)
- Hammer suit (AAAAAAAAAAAAA i don't think this will be that hard I just need the delay to be lower or something)
- clear pipes How the fuck am I supposed to be able to add that
- control as pop up window
- changelogs as pop up window
- private lobbies (this is painful because of uploading levels. also i need to rework this to use an automatic code system like ADASIGHA)
- flip blocks (for smw)
- tile animations to editor
- sex except only player with username "terminalarch" is able to use it
